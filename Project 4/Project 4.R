#2. Visualize the correlations you have computed. There are a few different ways to  do this (including scatterplots, heat maps, etc.). Use the visualization method that you think best conveys the relations.

# 3. Provide a summary of what you see in these results. Explain the nature of the bivariate relations (or lack thereof) in these data. Write this summary like you  might see reported in a journal article

# 4. Run correlations separately for each of these two subsamples. Report the results for each and provide an interpretation of what you see as you did in Questions 2 and 3. Are the correlations the same across the subsamples and/or from the entire sample? Iâ€™m not asking for a test of statistical significance, but your own  interpretation based on the values you compute.

# Select columns
selected_columns <- hrdata_df %>%

# Interpretation of results ****TO EXPAND ON*****
# Based on the correlation matrices and heatmaps for both males and females, we can observe the following:
# The strength and direction of correlations between variables may differ between males and females.
# For example, the correlation between Salary and Age might be stronger in one gender compared to the other.
# Similarly, the relationship between EngagementSurvey and EmpSatisfaction could vary across genders.
# These differences suggest that gender may play a role in how these variables are related to each other.
# Overall, the correlations in the subsamples provide a more nuanced understanding of the data compared to the entire sample.
