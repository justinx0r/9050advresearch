# 1.Report the full covariance and correlation matrix for the following variables: GenderID, PerfScoreID, Salary, Age, EngagementSurvey, EmpSatisfaction, and Absences.  
 
# 2. Visualize the correlations you have computed. There are a few different ways to do this (including scatterplots, heat maps, etc.). Use the visualization method that you think best conveys the relations. 
 
# 3. Provide a summary of what you see in these results. Explain the nature of the bivariate relations (or lack thereof) in these data. Write this summary like you might see reported in a journal article. 
 
## Create a subset of the data in which you only include employees who are from the Production Department. Also, create a subset of everyone NOT in Production.  
 
# 4. Run correlations separately for each of these two subsamples. Report the results for each and provide an interpretation of what you see as you did in Questions 2 and 3. Are the correlations the same across the subsamples and/or from the entire sample? Iâ€™m not asking for a test of statistical significance, but your own interpretation based on the values you compute.
